Before Cloud Computuing :
1. Buy a stack of servers
2. High Traffice -> More Servers
3. Monitoring and Maintaining of Servers

Disadvantages of this:
1. Setup is very expensive
2. Troubleshooting problems can be tedious and conflict with businees goals
3. Since traffic is varying servers will be idle most of the time (Servers are'nt fully used)

CLoud Computing Service Models
1. Iaas
2. Paas
3. Saas

Saas -> Software as a service
        1. Cloud privoider leases applications / softwares which are owned by them  to client
        

Paas -> Platform as a service
        1. Its like AWS Lambda
        2. We have no control over underlying architecture like OS, Storage , Server etc..
        3. THe Cloud Provider gives ability to client to deploy custom created apps using programming lang, tools etc that are provided by Clod Provider
        
Iaas -> Infrastructurre as a service
        1. Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet
        2. No worries about physical machine
        3.  Abstract user from physical machine
        

Deployment Methods
1. Public Cloud
2. Private Cloud
3. Hybrid Cloud
